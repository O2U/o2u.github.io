### Funding Information
#### Current
2021 – 2023.

Creation of a novel biomarker for leptospirosis using the adipose tissue colonization mechanism of *Leptospira*.

Project PI (4,550,000 JPY)

Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)

Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research: Early-Career Scientists (#21K16320)

#### Past
2018 – 2021.

Investigation of molecular mechanisms of leptospiral colonization on host adipose tissue.

Project PI (4,160,000 JPY)

Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)
